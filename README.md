# Turnstile-Weather

For this project, I used Python to investigate the interrelationship between weather conditions in New York City and turnstile entries at the Times Square subway station over the past year. To do so, I first wrote a script to wrangle datasets from the Weather Underground and Metro Transit Authority websites respectively. This code is modifiable to investigate any NYC station(s) over any time period. Next, I used Python's Anaconda distribution's library of data science modules to analyze, visualize, and predict ridership trends.
